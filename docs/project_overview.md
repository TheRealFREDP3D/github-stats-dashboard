```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Custom Hooks:** Encapsulate complex logic (API calls, mobile detection)
- **Context API:** Global state for LLM configuration
- **Service Layer:** Separate API logic from UI components
- **Composition:** Small, focused components that compose together

## 🔐 Security Model

### Current Implementation
- **Client-Side Only:** No backend server
- **LocalStorage:** API keys stored in browser localStorage
- **Direct API Calls:** Browser → GitHub/LLM APIs (no proxy)

### Security Limitations
⚠️ **Important:** This is a prototype with known security trade-offs:

| Aspect | Current State | Production Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|
| API Keys | Stored in localStorage | Use backend proxy with encrypted storage |
| XSS Protection | Basic (React's built-in) | Implement Content Security Policy |
| Rate Limiting | Client-side awareness only | Server-side rate limiting |
| Token Rotation | Manual | Automated rotation with refresh tokens |

### Acceptable Because
- Educational/personal use tool
- User has full control over their own keys
- No sensitive data stored
- All API calls are to official APIs (GitHub, OpenRouter, etc.)

---

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
- Fast initial load (Vite optimizations)
- Lazy loading for detail views
- Efficient re-renders with proper React patterns

### Known Limitations
- Large repositories (100+ files) slow down AI analysis
- GitHub API rate limits (5,000 requests/hour)
- No caching between sessions
- Traffic data limited to 14 days (GitHub API constraint)

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Implement request caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large repos
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & TODOs

### Critical Issues
- None currently identified

### Minor Issues
1. No error boundaries for graceful failure handling
2. No loading states for slow LLM responses
3. Mobile layout could be improved for very small screens

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Convert to TypeScript for type safety
- [ ] Implement proper error handling patterns
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- [ ] Create `.env.example` for configuration documentation

- ✅ API integration and error handling
- ✅ Modern CSS with Tailwind
- ✅ Animation with Framer Motion
