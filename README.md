![LLM Suggestions](assets/llm_suggestions.png)

- **Context Management**: Uses React Context API for LLM configuration and state management

#### LLM Integration Architecture

The AI analysis feature consists of several key components:

- **`LLMContext.jsx`**: React context providing LLM configuration and API keys across the application
- **`llmService.js`**: Unified service handling communication with different LLM providers
- **`useRepoAnalysis.js`**: Custom hook managing the analysis workflow and state
- **`RepoAnalysis.jsx`**: UI component displaying analysis results and suggestions
- **`LLMSettingsDialog.jsx`**: Configuration interface for selecting providers and managing API keys

#### Supported LLM Providers

| Provider | Model Support | API Key Required | Configuration |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **OpenRouter** | Various open-source models | Yes | API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision | Yes | API key from [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Vision | Yes | API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |

#### Analysis Process

1. **Repository Scanning**: Fetches complete file tree and content using GitHub API
2. **Content Processing**: Extracts and prepares code for analysis
3. **LLM Query**: Sends structured prompts to the selected provider
4. **Response Parsing**: Processes JSON responses containing analysis data
5. **UI Presentation**: Displays results in an organized, readable format

## Getting Started

### 🔑 Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Stats Dashboard")
4. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories (required for traffic data)
   - OR `public_repo` - Access to public repositories only
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!

### 🖥️ Using the Dashboard

1. Open the deployed dashboard URL
2. Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token into the input field
3. Click **"Load Repositories"**
4. Browse your repository cards
5. Click any card to view detailed statistics and charts

### Configuring LLM Analysis

To use the AI-powered code analysis feature:

1. Access the settings by clicking the settings icon in the dashboard header or within a repository detail view
2. Select your preferred LLM provider (OpenRouter, Gemini, or OpenAI)
3. Enter your API key for the selected provider:
   - [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
   - [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev)
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
4. Your API keys are stored locally in your browser's localStorage for convenience

## Development

### Development Workflow

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or higher
- **pnpm**: Version 8.0 or higher (recommended package manager)
- **Git**: For version control

#### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheRealFREDP3D/github-stats-dashboard
cd github-stats-dashboard

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# The application will be available at http://localhost:5173
```

#### Available Scripts

- **`pnpm run dev`** - Start development server with hot reload
- **`pnpm run build`** - Build for production
- **`pnpm run preview`** - Preview production build locally
- **`pnpm run lint`** - Run ESLint code quality checks

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Build Errors:**

```bash
# Clear pnpm cache and reinstall
pnpm store prune
pnpm install

# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
```

**GitHub API Issues:**

- Verify your Personal Access Token has the correct scopes (`repo` or `public_repo`)
- Check that you haven't exceeded GitHub's rate limits (5,000 requests/hour)
- Ensure the token is valid and not expired

**LLM Integration Issues:**

- Verify API keys are correctly configured in the settings dialog
- Check that the selected provider supports the models you're trying to use
- Ensure API keys have sufficient permissions and credits

**Performance Issues:**

- Large repositories may take time to analyze due to file size limits
- Consider using more powerful LLM models for better analysis quality
- The dashboard fetches data on load; refresh the page to update statistics

#### Debugging

**Development Tools:**

- Browser DevTools for network requests and console errors
- React DevTools for component inspection
- GitHub API rate limit monitoring in browser Network tab

**Logging:**

- The application logs API errors to the browser console
- LLM analysis progress and errors are logged for debugging

## Limitations

- **Traffic Data**: GitHub API only provides traffic data for the last 14 days
- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub API has rate limits (5,000 requests/hour for authenticated requests)
- **Repository Access**: You can only see statistics for repositories you have access to
- **Real-time Updates**: Data is fetched on load; refresh to see updated statistics

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:

- Historical data storage to track trends beyond 14 days
- Comparison view between multiple repositories
- Export functionality for statistics
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Filtering and sorting options
- Search functionality
- Organization repository support
- Webhook integration for real-time updates

## Security Notes

- Your GitHub token is stored only in your browser's memory during the session
- The token is never sent to any server except GitHub's official API
- Always use tokens with minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate your tokens for security
- Never share your tokens or commit them to version control
- LLM API keys are stored in your browser's localStorage; consider rotating them regularly and avoid using keys with excessive permissions
